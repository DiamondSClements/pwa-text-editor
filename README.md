# PWA Text Editor

## Description 
The PWA Text Editor is an application that allows users to create and save notes or code snippets. 
It is designed to function seamlessly both online and offline, providing a reliable platform for users to create and retrieve content.

## Installation
* This assignment was equipped with starter code that I retrieved from the class repository.
* I had to implement "npm install" to install the dependecies and finished writing the code that was missing in the database.js, install.js, and webpack.config files.

## Usage 
* Open the PWA Text Editor in your browser.
* Create or edit text content in the editor.
* Content is automatically saved using IndexedDB when you click off the DOM window.
* Retrieve your content even after closing the application.
